#Project demo

The project contains a simple express server to proxy the rest api requests.

I developed a simple windowing technique to reduce performance issues on long list loads

Useful documentations could be find through the code

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the server and app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
I also included majestic to have a nice gui for it

### `yarn majestic`
Runs majestic app with npx

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
